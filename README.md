## Description

This website was built during the prework modules for the DU Coding Bootcamp. The site acts both as a practical application and demonstration of the skills learned during this prework and also a tool for studying the four main areas of learning: HTML, CCS, Git and JavaScript. 

Throughout the process, we learned the basics of coding and installed the proper software needed to be successful in class.
